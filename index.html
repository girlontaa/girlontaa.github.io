        Hi there! I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Communications and minoring in Media Arts and Design. Born in Romania and raised in the United States, I’ve always been fascinated by the rich contrasts between the two cultures that have shaped my identity. My passion for exploring these differences has fueled my interest in the diverse expressions of music, food, language, arts, found in both Romanian and American cultures! </span></p>
