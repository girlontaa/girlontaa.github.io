    <h1>Fairy Lantern</h1>
    <h4>by Ana Girlonta</h4>
    <img src="project1.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This lantern is a harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetic appeal, designed to enchant and illuminate anyoneâ€™s room. Each aspect of its design serves a specific purpose while contributing to the overall magical ambiance. I used Fusion 360 to design, and fabricated using a laser cutter to cut 1/4" wooden slabs that were press-fit together. Its delicate patterns and soft pink hue evoke the charm of a magical forest, while the twinkling fairy lights inside create a serene and captivating ambiance!</p>

    <h1>Earthenware Vase</h1>

    <img src="project2.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>TThis was crafted as part of a 3D Design project, where polymer clay was shaped and hardened in an oven to create a functional and decorative piece. With its colorful dynamic swirls on the clay and touch of natural elegance of the dried lavender in it, this work merges both form and function.</p>
