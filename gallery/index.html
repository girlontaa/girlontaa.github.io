    <h1>Fairy Lantern</h1>
    <h4>by Ana Girlonta</h4>
    <img src="project1.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This lantern is a harmonious blend of functionality and aesthetic appeal, designed to enchant and illuminate anyoneâ€™s room. Each aspect of its design serves a specific purpose while contributing to the overall magical ambiance. I used Fusion 360 to design, and fabricated using a laser cutter to cut 1/4" wooden slabs that were press-fit together. Its delicate patterns and soft pink hue evoke the charm of a magical forest, while the twinkling fairy lights inside create a serene and captivating ambiance!</p>

    <p>TThis was crafted as part of a 3D Design project, where polymer clay was shaped and hardened in an oven to create a functional and decorative piece. With its colorful dynamic swirls on the clay and touch of natural elegance of the dried lavender in it, this work merges both form and function.</p>

    <h1>Organic Blossoms</h1>
    <h4>by Ana Girlonta</h4>
    <img src="project3.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>In this, I was inspired to blend elements of the sea with the tranquility of nature. This was designed using dried eucalyptus leaves, shells from St Augustine Beach in Florida, and pearl beads glued on a painted canvas. Seashells and a sand dollar are arranged in a floral composition, set against a soft blue background that evokes the serenity of the ocean. The subtle use of green leaves is intended to add a touch of natural vibrancy, making this piece a simple harmonious blend of marine life and botanical beauty.</p>
